# IPL-Cricket-Analysis-Dashboard
Problem Statement:

The Indian Premier League (IPL) generates massive volumes of data each season, including player statistics, team performances, and match results. However, raw data tables make it difficult to quickly derive insights, compare performances, or spot trends over time.

The problem is: ‚ÄúHow can we transform IPL data into a visually interactive dashboard that provides meaningful insights for fans, analysts, and decision-makers?‚Äù

This dashboard solves the problem by:
Aggregating IPL data into a structured and interactive Power BI dashboard.
Allowing quick comparison between players, teams, and seasons.
Providing decision-making insights such as best performers, winning factors, and performance trends.
